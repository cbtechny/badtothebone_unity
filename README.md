## Bad to the Bone (Made with Unity Engine)

### A Game by **[NinjaPirateRobotAlien](http://ninjapiraterobotalien.com/)**

***

Game was prototyped with Godot Engine, and with its latest release, it made some of the code unusable. Rather than redo some of the project for Godot 4, it was decided to switch to Unity Engine and make a new program from scratch.

**Bad to the Bone** is a *casual endless runner* made to run on web browsers. The player takes the role of a skeleton greaser making his way through obstacles and collecting musical notes.

All art and code has been reworked and redone from scratch.

### This README file will also serve as a game journal/devlog, in case anyone joins the team.

# **Devlog**

#### Thursday, June 1, 2023:

Some of the script references and documentation have been implemented
in local workstation-not in working repo currently. Will be added shortly, once placeholder assets are swapped out.

Overall, it's looking like, other than the UI, there won't be too many scripts to run the game loop and record a high score.

Which reminds me... Need a database to store high scores!

After writing the previous iteration of this game in *Godot Engine*, 
but stopped due to the nature of the changes from Godot 3.5 to Godot 4.

I like the ease of GDScript and enjoyed the small, GitHub-friendly file sizes, but decided after all that, it would be best to stick to Unity. 


As a solo developer, Unity's asset store will save me a lot of time with scripting and art.



I *did* have to rethink version control, and have been *adapting* to Plastic SCM. I will say, its GUI system is a lot more friendly than the cold hard CLI I'm used to in GIt. Let's see how this all goes.



I wonder if there is way to make these darn Unity project files smaller? *Like, do we need all this junk?!*
